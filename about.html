            <p>Cole S. Smith is an up and coming web developer, who has found a strong passion for JS and CSS; not to say that he is new to the world of websites. Before delving deep into web development, he ran a myriad of other businesses both online and off, with varying levels of success. This has granted him with a very diverse skill set, including the ability to adapt to new ideas and learn skills rapidly.</p>

            <p>    Ok, that's enough of the formal “Professional bio” part let's get into the meat of it. I LOVE DANK MONO, technology, music, and my first true love … World of Warcraft. My dream in life is playing vanilla WoW again (that's in there so that Blizz knows I’m still waiting). On the real though, I love web development. I think it is one of the funnest things you can do with your time IMHO (especially when you're looking at Dank Mono, just saying. Honestly, you should get that font). Oh yeah, back to me, I enjoy learning, growing and acquiring new talents. Who doesn't love getting better at what they do? Web development is awesome for me because it blends all the things I like so much. It was no surprise to me that when I got into it, I was totally consumed. I started reading, watching, and listening to everything I could; blowing through any courses I found online. I have always been a DIY’er when it comes to well…everything, but learning in particular. So imagine how happy I was to find a community that is all about self-learning, and full of people and courses to help along the way!</p>
            <br>
            <p>    My goals are to improve my toolset and continue to get paid to do what I love. I have a solid grasp on front-end javascript and markdown. I am in the process of learning WordPress as well as React, I’ll keep you up to date on how that goes. Bring me on your team and I challenge you to find a web development skill that I cannot learn. Let’s return to the “how to write a personal bio” to close this out now...</p>
            <br>
            <p>    Cole currently resides in Salt Lake City, Utah and is willing to relocate for interesting opportunities and adventures. He is available for web development and private consultations.Find his details on the contact page.</p>
